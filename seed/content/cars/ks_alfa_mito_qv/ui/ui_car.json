{"name":"Alfa Romeo Mito QV","brand":"Alfa Romeo","description":"The Alfa Romeo MiTo Quadrifoglio mounts a new 1.4-litre MultiAir Turbo Petrol engine which develops 170hp at 5,500 rpm and up to 250 Nm at 2,500rpm in Sport mode (230Nm in Natural or All-weather modes). </br></br>The MultiAir electrohydraulic valve management system reduces fuel consumption by controlling intake air directly via the inlet valves (without using the throttle) and reduces polluting emissions by using extremely precise combustion control.</br></br>It's fitted with the Alfa Romeo's latest-generation, six-speed, double dry-clutch ALFA TCT transmission. As in the Alfa Giulietta, this new transmission offers automatic or sequential manual shifting, either via the gear lever or steering-wheel mounted paddle shifters, and can be reconfigured for different driving scenarios via the Alfa D.N.A. driving mode selector, which also tunes throttle response, engine performance, power steering assistance and the suspension depending on the mode.","tags":["#small sports","fwd","manual","turbo","street","hot hatchback","Italy"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"168bhp","torque":"250Nm","weight":"1140kg","topspeed":"219km/h","acceleration":"7.3s 0-100","pwratio":"6.7kg/cv","range":115},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","68"],["1000","76"],["1500","142"],["2000","213"],["2500","250"],["3000","241"],["3500","236"],["4000","230"],["4500","227"],["5000","220"],["5500","202"],["5750","185"],["6000","163"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","7"],["1000","10"],["1500","33"],["2000","56"],["2500","86"],["3000","101"],["3500","112"],["4000","129"],["4500","142"],["5000","155"],["5500","170"],["5750","146"],["6000","137"]]}
