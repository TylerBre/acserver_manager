{"name":"BMW 1M Stage 3","parent":"bmw_1m","brand":"BMW","description":"The Stage 3 tuned version of BMW 1M series has adjustable aftermarket dampers with coilover springs, camber plates to adjust for massive range of camber at the front, and rear toe links for equally big range of camber adjustment at the rear. The engine is tuned with a new ECU that raises the turbo boost at over 1bar with an overboost function of over 1.3 bar, adjustable from the cockpit. Beware though, the engine can't handle that kind of pressure for too much time.<br/><br/>The letter M now comes to the segment of the BMW 1 Series to symbolise outstanding power delivery and the highly dynamic driving properties of a high-performance sports car. </br>In the BMW 1 Series M Coupe, the technology of a high-performance car is combined with the agility and lightness of a compact model to create a whole new dimension of sports-style driving pleasure.
