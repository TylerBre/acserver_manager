The 12C GT3 is based on the new MP4-12C high-performance sports car and a team of engineers, designers and test drivers with vast experience in Formula 1 and GT racing has been assembled to undertake the process of adapting the carbon chassis-based 12C to racing specification.</br></br> Just as with the 12C road car, McLaren is working closely with specialist suppliers to deliver an innovative and lightweight car. The 3.8-litre McLaren V8 twin turbo M838T' engine supplied in the road car also features in the 12C GT3, but de-tuned to 500 PS (from 600 PS) in order to provide optimum power for this performance-balanced race car.</br></br> The new MP4-12C GT3 will feature a unique engine calibration, bespoke racing transmission developed in partnership with Ricardo (who also developed the engine with McLaren) and a suspension arrangement tuned specifically for racing.","tags":["#GTE-GT3","rwd","race","sequential","gt","gt3","Great Britain"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"493 bhp","torque":"500Nm","weight":"1245kg","topspeed":"275+km/h","acceleration":"--s","pwratio":"2.52kg/cv","range":190},"torqueCurve":[["0","56"],["500","360"],["1000","398"],["1500","434"],["2000","450"],["2500","473"],["3000","498"],["3500","516"],["4000","523"],["4500","517"],["5000","502"],["5500","506"],["6000","497"],["6500","504"],["7000","507"],["7500","472"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","25"],["1000","55"],["1500","91"],["2000","126"],["2500","166"],["3000","209"],["3500","253"],["4000","293"],["4500","326"],["5000","352"],["5500","390"],["6000","418"],["6500","460"],["7000","500"],["7500","497"]]}
