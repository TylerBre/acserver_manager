{"name":"Ford Mustang 2015","brand":"Ford","description":"The way Mustang looks, drives and sounds is key to the visceral experience that makes drivers just want to get in and hit the road. With more options to choose from, there is a Mustang to fit any lifestyle. <br><br>Mustang GT continues with the latest edition of the throaty 5.0-liter V8, now featuring an upgraded valvetrain and cylinder heads that yield more than 420 horsepower and 390 lb.-ft. of torque. A new intake manifold improves low-speed breathing for better fuel economy, idle stability and emissions.<br><br>The feeling of freedom and confidence Mustang instills in its drivers is amplified when they can take control of how the car behaves. On a twisty back road or a weekend track day, the driver can tap the toggle switches on the console to quickly adjust steering effort, engine response, and transmission and electronic stability control settings using the available Selectable Drive Modes to create the perfect Mustang at any time.","tags":["#Sportscars","V8","manual","street","usa"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"435bhp","torque":"542Nm","weight":"1680kg","topspeed":"250km/h","acceleration":"4.4s 0-100","pwratio":"3.84kg/hp","range":180},"torqueCurve":[["500","318"],["1000","351"],["1500","389"],["2000","425"],["2500","461"],["3000","487"],["3500","538"],["4000","556"],["4500","546"],["5000","541"],["5500","536"],["6000","502"],["6400","484"],["6500","471"],["7000","425"],["7500","155"]],"powerCurve":[["500","22"],["1000","49"],["1500","82"],["2000","119"],["2500","162"],["3000","205"],["3500","264"],["4000","312"],["4500","345"],["5000","380"],["5500","414"],["6000","423"],["6400","435"],["6500","430"],["7000","418"],["7500","163"]]}
