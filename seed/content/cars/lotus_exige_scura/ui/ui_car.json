{"name":"Lotus Exige Scura","brand":"Lotus","description":"Lotus Cars unveils its latest special edition - the Exige Scura, so called due to its dramatic matt black and carbon fibre theme, at the Tokyo International Motorshow on 21st of October 2009. <br/><br/>Translated as 'dark' from Italian, the name 'Scura' reflects the stealth character of this already fierce looking Lotus and its stunning soft-feel matt black paint finish. Limited to just 35 cars globally, this Exige evokes a desire to 'indulge your dark side'.<br/><br/>Whilst there is no doubt that this is a visually stunning car, the Exige Scura is not just about its looks - it begs to be taken on track, and its racing character encompasses poise, power and technology to make it a serious contender. Equipped with the most powerful engine in the Exige range and generating 260PS, the Exige Scura achieves a top speed of around 245 km/h and reaches 0-100 kmh in just 4.1 seconds.","tags":["#Sportscars","rwd","manual","compressor","lightweight","street","Great Britain"],"class":"street","specs":{"Tyres":"Semis","extras":"stock","bhp":"257 bhp","torque":"243Nm","weight":"925kg","topspeed":"245km/h","acceleration":"4.1s 0-100","pwratio":"3.60kg/cv","range":87},"torqueCurve":[["0","56"],["500","98"],["1000","160"],["1500","170"],["2000","174"],["2500","188"],["3000","206"],["3500","208"],["4000","212"],["4500","231"],["5000","234"],["5500","233"],["6000","236"],["6500","232"],["7000","233"],["7500","230"],["8000","228"],["8500","206"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","7"],["1000","22"],["1500","36"],["2000","49"],["2500","66"],["3000","87"],["3500","102"],["4000","119"],["4500","146"],["5000","164"],["5500","180"],["6000","198"],["6500","212"],["7000","229"],["7500","242"],["8000","256"],["8500","246"]]}
