{"name":"Lotus Exige S roadster","brand":"Lotus","description":"More raw than a Japanese tasting menu, the Lotus Exige S Roadster combines its coup twin's mesmerizing grunt and handling with an open air experience that makes the driver feel all the more at one with the road.</br></br>It's the first time an Exige model has been offered with a factory-fitted soft top roof, one which is typically lightweight and easy to put up and take down. In true Lotus fashion the finely tuned suspension delivers a responsive ride and sublimely agile handling, whilst the supercharged 3.5 V6 engine with race-derived technologies delivers stunning performance.","tags":["#Sportscars","rwd","manual","compressor","trackday","street","Great Britain"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"345bhp","torque":"400Nm","weight":"1166kg","topspeed":"233+km/h","acceleration":"4.0s 0-100","pwratio":"3.38kg/hp","range":83},"torqueCurve":[["0","56"],["500","187"],["1000","271"],["1500","316"],["2000","342"],["2500","368"],["3000","383"],["3500","392"],["4000","394"],["4500","400"],["5000","392"],["5500","392"],["6000","383"],["6500","360"],["7000","347"],["7250","339"],["7500","325"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","13"],["1000","38"],["1500","67"],["2000","96"],["2500","129"],["3000","161"],["3500","193"],["4000","221"],["4500","252"],["5000","275"],["5500","303"],["6000","323"],["6500","329"],["7000","341"],["7250","345"],["7500","342"]]}
