It became the most successful touring car of all times by winning the two champion's titles in the European Touring Car Championship and twice in the German Touring Car Championship. There were also numerous further victories and championship wins at international level.<br/><br/>The 1990-1992 cars of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) were the most extreme versions and reached their maximum potential, with engines screaming over 9000RPM and outputs of over 350 bhp. The chassis was heavily modified and reinforced to support the extremely stiff suspensions that characterised the cars of the day. In the latest versions of the car ABS was also permitted in the DTM championship and the teams could setup their cars with gearboxes featuring 6 ratios.
