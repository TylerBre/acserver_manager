{"name":"BMW M3 E30","brand":"BMW","description":"Based on the 1986 model year E30 3-Series, the E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four cylinder engine.The production of the E30 road car was to homologate the M3 for Group A Touring Car racing. <br/><br/>The Sport Evolution model production run of 600 (sometimes referred as EVO3) increased engine displacement to 2.5 L and produced 235 hp (175 kW). Sport Evolution models have enlarged front bumper openings and an adjustable multi-position front splitter and rear wing. Brake cooling ducts were installed in place of front foglights. An additional 786 convertibles were also produced.<br/><br/>To keep the car competitive in racing following year-to-year homologation rules changes, homologation specials were produced. Homologation (motorsport) rules roughly stated that the race version must reflect the street car aerodynamically and in engine displacement. These include: the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution some of which featured less weight, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (Sport Evolution; to further facilitate 18-inch (460 mm) wheels in DTM), brake ducting, and more power. Other limited-production models (based on evolution models but featuring special paintwork and/or unique interior schemes commemorating championship wins) include the Europa, Ravaglia, Cecotto, and Europameister. Production of the original E30 M3 ended in early 1992.","tags":["#small sports","rwd","manual","street","germany","vintage"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"238 bhp","torque":"240Nm","weight":"1200kg","topspeed":"248km/h","acceleration":"7.4s 0-100","pwratio":"5.04 kg/bhp","range":89},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","100"],["1000","138"],["1500","165"],["2000","171"],["2500","174"],["3000","183"],["3500","217"],["4000","236"],["4500","238"],["4750","240"],["5000","238"],["5500","239"],["6000","238"],["6500","238"],["7000","240"],["7250","234"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","7"],["1000","19"],["1500","35"],["2000","48"],["2500","61"],["3000","77"],["3500","107"],["4000","133"],["4500","150"],["4750","160"],["5000","167"],["5500","185"],["6000","201"],["6500","217"],["7000","236"],["7250","238"]]}
