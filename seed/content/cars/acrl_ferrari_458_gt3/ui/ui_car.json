{"name":"Ferrari 458 GT3","brand":"Ferrari","description":"The Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 mod is based on the 458 GT2 chassis. In order to make it realistic it has been altered to match its real life GT3 equivalent to an AssettoCorsa trim to match the performance of the other GT3 cars. It has a completely new power curve and would like you to rev to 9000, not the measly 7500.</br></br> NOTE: The ingame torque and power curves are not representative.","tags":["#A5","rwd","race","sequential","gt","gt3","italy"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"500 bhp","torque":"550Nm","weight":"1215kg","topspeed":"270+km/h","acceleration":"--sec","pwratio":"N/A","range":195},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","176"],["1000","269"],["1500","363"],["2000","406"],["2500","432"],["3000","456"],["3500","497"],["4000","505"],["4500","507"],["5000","524"],["5500","534"],["6000","531"],["6500","529"],["7000","491"],["7500","442"],["8000","412"],["8500","379"],["9000","355"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","12"],["1000","38"],["1500","76"],["2000","114"],["2500","152"],["3000","192"],["3500","244"],["4000","284"],["4500","320"],["5000","368"],["5500","412"],["6000","447"],["6500","483"],["7000","483"],["7500","466"],["8000","463"],["8500","452"],["8750","449"]]}
