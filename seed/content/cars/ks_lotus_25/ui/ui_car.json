This was three times stiffer than the Lotus 24, while the chassis weighed only half as much. The car also was extremely low and narrow, with a smaller frontal area and was nicknamed 'The Bathtub' since the driver has to sit reclined behind the wheel.<br><br>In the hands of Jim Clark it took 14 World Championship Grand Prix wins and propelled him to his 1963 World Championship title.<br><br>","tags":["#Lotus25","rwd","race","manual","F1","singleseater","vintage","Great Britain"],"class":"race","specs":{"bhp":"195 bhp","torque":"160 Nm","weight":"451 kg","topspeed":"km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"2.31 kg/bhp","range":350},"torqueCurve":[["500","89"],["1000","89"],["1500","89"],["2000","89"],["2500","89"],["3000","85"],["3500","89"],["4000","93"],["4500","97"],["5000","101"],["5500","105"],["6000","129"],["6500","156"],["7000","155"],["7500","156"],["8000","160"],["8500","157"],["9000","152"],["9500","146"],["10000","131"]],"powerCurve":[["500","6"],["1000","12"],["1500","19"],["2000","25"],["2500","31"],["3000","36"],["3500","44"],["4000","52"],["4500","61"],["5000","71"],["5500","81"],["6000","109"],["6500","142"],["7000","152"],["7500","164"],["8000","180"],["8500","187"],["9000","192"],["9500","195"],["10000","184"]]}
