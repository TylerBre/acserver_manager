{"name":"Toyota Supra MKIV Time Attack","brand":"Toyota","description":"Toyota Supra was one of the finest Japanese supercar: through tuning it easily reaches 600hp and can go over 1000hp.<br><br>It's revered as one of the most highly tuneable cars on the planet. The time attack version has much better aerodynamics and plenty of setup options. A much bigger single turbine and tuned engine for higher power make this a very capable car, if you can handle the turbo lag.","tags":["#Sportscars","rwd","manual","street","turbo","japan"],"class":"racing","specs":{"bhp":"690bhp","torque":"756Nm","weight":"1505kg","topspeed":"--km/h","acceleration":"--s 0-100","pwratio":"2.18kg/hp"},"torqueCurve":[["500","270"],["1000","354"],["1500","387"],["2000","435"],["2500","609"],["3000","651"],["3500","603"],["4000","669"],["4200","711"],["4500","741"],["4750","747"],["5000","756"],["5500","747"],["6000","741"],["6500","732"],["7000","702"],["7250","573"],["7500","414"],["8000","387"]],"powerCurve":[["500","19"],["1000","50"],["1500","82"],["2000","122"],["2500","214"],["3000","274"],["3500","296"],["4000","376"],["4200","419"],["4500","468"],["4750","498"],["5000","531"],["5500","577"],["6000","624"],["6500","668"],["7000","690"],["7250","583"],["7500","436"],["8000","435"]]}
