In its first year it competed vigorously in events such as the SUPER GT GT300, the Super Taikyu and the British GT Championship and it attained a number of podium finishes. Furthermore, in 2013 it was the Blancpain Endurance Series Pro-Am class championship vehicle.</br></br>Using the same VR38DETT engine used in mass production vehicles, it has a maximum output of more than 550ps, generating a maximum torque of over 65.0kgf/m. With only a 6-speed sequential spec gearbox equipped with a semi-automatic paddle shift, the drive system is a FIA regulation approved rear wheel drive. Even more than the 2013 model, which has already demonstrated its speed in the GT3 race world, reliability has been improved and a total reduction in running costs has been achieved.
