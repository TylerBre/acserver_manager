{"name":"Abarth 500 EsseEsse Step1","parent":"abarth500","brand":"Abarth","description":"The Step1 tuned version of Abarth500 EsseEsse has non adjustable aftermarket dampers and lowered springs and an ECU reprogramming which gives a little more boost on the turbos, gaining a fair amount of power and torque.Turning the modern Fiat 500 into an Abarth meant lowering the ride, adding a turbocharger to the 1.4-litre engine (no mean feat under that tiny bonnet), giving it Torque Transfer Control for more aggressive cornering and improving the aerodynamics with side-skirts and spoilers.<br/><br/>The little Abarth is fast, very agile and plenty of fun.","tags":["#small sports","fwd","manual","turbo","street","hot hatchback","italy"],"class":"street","specs":{"bhp":"175bhp","torque":"245Nm","weight":"1025kg","topspeed":"211km/h","acceleration":"7.4s 0-100","pwratio":"6.40kg/hp","range":65},"torqueCurve":[["0","0"],["500","137"],["1000","155"],["1500","171"],["2000","176"],["2500","189"],["3000","245"],["3500","245"],["4000","235"],["4500","233"],["5000","235"],["5500","226"],["5750","217"],["6000","201"],["6500","181"]],"powerCurve":[["0","0"],["500","10"],["1000","22"],["1500","36"],["2000","49"],["2500","66"],["3000","102"],["3500","119"],["4000","132"],["4500","147"],["5000","165"],["5500","175"],["5750","175"],["6000","168"],["6500","165"]]}
