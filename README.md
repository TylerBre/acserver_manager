Acserver Manager is designed to be the only solution you will need to manage a dedicated server for Assetto Corsa.

It aims to provide elegant interfaces and automation for:
- ~~Uploading third-party cars and tracks~~ âœ”
- Uploading custom skins
- Updating the Assetto Corsa Dedicated server app
- Editing ```server_cfg.ini``` and ```driver_list.ini``` files
- Managing 3rd-party apps such as stracker
- Starting and Stopping the server

As well as to add new features entirely:
- Rotate server setup on race end
- Automated driverlists
- Series presets
- Car list presets
- Race-specific content bundles
- ... and more!

The app is designed to run on incredibly affordable ($5/mo) [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) boxes, and launched from a pre-built image. This will also grant users the ability to launch a dedicated server worldwide, minimizing ping. It is possible to install and run this app locally on your home computer.

### Disclaimer
This app is very much in a development state at the moment, but please feel free to try it out, make some pull requests and contribute to the code!

Happy hacking!

# Installation

Though Acserver Manager will be bundled inside of a VM image for easy installation, in the meantime, you'll need to run it in a standolone environment.

As this is being developed for deployment to a 32-bit Ubuntu 15 installation, I recommend you do the same, either with Digital Ocean, or a local environment. However, if you have your own Linux installation and are comfortable with some googling when things go wrong, the installation procedure should be pretty similar.

### Requirements

<strong>postgresql</strong>
```
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
<strong>node.js</strong>

$ rm node-v5.5.0-linux-x86.tar.gz
```
<strong>p7zip-full + p7zip-rar</strong>
